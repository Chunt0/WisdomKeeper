 about and then it doesn't matter that it's like one of kind of like scattered bullet points. Totally. Oh, this is what they're talking about. Oh, but I guess like, yeah, I feel like for now this works, maybe we can keep tweaking it and find a better tool, but at least we have the transcription and an audio document for reference. Because also it might, I guess we can try it too, because it might be such that like the speaker turned thing. Sometimes you probably won't be able to distinguish it, but other times it's like you probably won't remember like who's present, you know, the conversation. So it's like, yeah, who's talked about what? It's just Chris's idea. And that's the part I want to record or write down. Yeah. So I guess what, what we're going to do moving forward is we'll record a meeting about some topic, what like in this case we're talking about building this transcription application that can take meetings and then output a like a sort of secretary's notes of the meeting. And we'll use this, this output that we get. And I guess maybe package it in a nicer way. And then we can possibly send it to chat GBT and see what sort of output comes out of it in a summarization. All right. I'm trying to look at, maybe prior to you looked at this, but I'm looking at open source meeting transcription. I haven't done anything like that. What are you finding? What are you finding? I might have found something this way. They just had to go list. Uh huh. Okay. Oh, transcribe. Pro-gressor JS. Let's see. Oh, transcribe. I'm guessing that this, this might be the place to be. It's good. I don't know. Yeah. So these are like, it's just trying to give me, like, is there a, a, program that you pay for it? Okay. Pro-gressor. Oh yeah. This, this seems pretty cool. Oh, and I can do translations. Oh yeah. It seems like somebody already figured this problem out. Cool. Download it. It's just a matter of, can we get this thing running? This is, well, yeah. This takes the fun out of it. Does it? How come, can someone figure it out already? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I kind of want to like mess around with this even. I mean, this might create, I mean, maybe this will create something that's a little bit more magical. Yeah, yeah, totally. I mean, I'm going to keep fucking with this. Yeah. You can, yeah, I'm done with whatever. Running tests. Ah, okay. Yeah, I'll tab this and come back to it later. Cool. But for now, I'll just keep doing this other thing. Yeah. So I've been running, I've been recording this talking, I guess, for four minutes so far. Cool. So, maybe let's move on to another topic and we'll see how the chat GPT handles it later. I guess this will be a good test too because we'll see how many tokens these meetings will have and we'll see how much we can load up into chat GPT's context window. Cool. Okay, so, yeah, here, since I only got about, I guess, about 15 minutes left, oh, that's plenty of time. Here, I'll show you the web app that I made and I got everything to work. So, yeah, let's get this back out of here. Do that. Okay. So, this is the first time I've ever done anything like this. It was basically prompted by a chat GPT. Like it gave me the base code and then I kind of like made it work for me. It's pretty neat. So it's the whole setting up a web, I don't even know what you call it, a web server is used this library called Flask and it has like this class called Flask in it, which is essentially your web application class object and it, I guess it uses a couple different other functions from this library. But essentially you create this sort of Flask object and you can run this app essentially and you can give it these different like roots that can like produce, I guess, scripts in HTML. So then it like bounces back and forth between this like HTML code and this Python application. So I guess like at the base of like a web server or a web application is you have your whatever your URL in this case, it just opens up an internal loop. You're all, I'll get it going for you to see. So yeah, so it runs a server, opens up the web server on like an internal loop back IP address, the 127.0.0.1 on the port 5000. And so this allows you to then like connect to this, this server, I guess is what you'd call it, this Flask application server. And the root directory is the backslash. I might be explaining more than or like, I might be explaining stuff you already know, but so like you can in this spot, it basically like you can do the uses of thing called a decorator, which I guess is what it assigns this function to this root. I'm not really sure. I need to learn more about decorators, but essentially when when you open up that port or access that port to the web server, it'll go to this like index root and it'll run this function, which is basically it, it'll, it can, you can basically do a bunch of stuff in this index function, which is, which is basically your index of your, your web application, your root directory of your web application. And so like here I have, I've made this function up here get questions. And essentially what's happening is it's opening up a file on my, on my server, in this case it's my computer, the data dot CSV file. And it's taking that info and make turning into two lists. I have this CSV file and it's basically like takes, it takes this column, the zero, the recorded column, which is a, it's either a zero or a one. And then that takes the questions column and assigns them to two lists and then returns them to variables. And then you have this render template function that comes from flask that essentially passes these variables to index dot html, which is your html code that gets run on the, the application. So we can like bounce over here. And essentially what's happening is, so this is just some like, to T T, T T, T, T, T, that HTML stuff. I don't really know if the define this doc type, it defines what type of document it is, the language. You have your header stuff, you have like metadata, and then you have like the title that appears at the top of the tab or whatever. And then you have your body. And so this part is basically just like, it's, it lays out what's on the page. You have like, each one is essentially just like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a text size. It's like this, it makes this essentially. And then the stuff you were just explaining before. Yeah. So what's going on here is it's assigning about a variable ID from whatever. What is it? I actually don't quite know what's going on here. Yeah. This part's confusing. So I know that I'm passing these, these lists to the HTML, the recorded list and the questions list. And so it's doing something where it's, it's either like using, I think what it's doing is so when it, when we pass these lists to the HTML here to the JavaScript. Yeah. Stuff, it's, it's JSON of buying it. Okay. So it essentially is like taking the list and turning it into some type of JSON file. Markup, it's, it's, it's a turning it into a markup file. Or a markup file. Yeah. So it, like, JSON and XML. They're like a, oh, it's a type of markup file. Yeah. Yeah. So like in this case, it's like taking one kind of data and then like transcribing it basically so that like machine readable and good cause markup is usually like machine readable and like a human readable. Okay. You know, like somewhere between so that it's like making this JSON file that it can pass to the HTML I think. Mm hmm. Or sorry to the, to the Python. Okay. That's, that's because. Well, anyway, yes. I have a question. Yeah. What's up? Is there a way, um, so I don't have you. So I made this like, uh, thread on the platform. Like, like, work for questions. What was it work for questions? Do this. It's, it's just like for, uh, I got questions data set. Let's see. What's it? Oh, yeah. There we go. And so that is like where we can then start collecting. Our own questions. Oh, okay. Which there's nothing really on there. That's just like those are the social shadow questions. Oh, okay. Here. And then I'm just trying to find, you know, like different questions. And so I was talking to Darius, because I was telling him just what, like you're working on. Yeah. And I was wondering if we came up with an idea, like what if it's the, um, what if like the questions were like, uh, randomized? Yeah. You know, like they're still the same. One hundred, one thousand questions. Like we decide that. Yeah. Like stays fixed. Mm hmm. But then that would be cool if the questions could be like on this forum. We're random because we were talking about it. We were like, if we were to like lay traps, like on like Billy Billy or like Twitter or whatever, or trying to get people to answer questions. Um, the idea would be like an understanding that most people aren't going to get through all 1000. Yeah. So then like randomizing them. So we have, uh, like a statistical average, you know, so it's not like, oh, we have like 600 answers for questions one through three. And only 20 answers for three through 50. Mm hmm. Zero answers for like, uh, 100 through a thousand. Mm hmm. You know, you kind of try and average. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, get answers to all of the questions. Mm hmm. Uh, through like a mean. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's totally, that's totally doable. Yeah. Um, though the way I have it, I have it set up here now is, is basically for personal use. So like you would, you would clone this repo and you would run this web app on your, you know, do the loop back thing and you'd be running it locally and you'd be recording and storing the data on your own computer. So, but, um, and we can randomize that too. Um, I also, I mean, in, we were going to, I was going to get to it, but you can see here like I have this thing where you can like click, if you don't want to answer a question, you can like go to the next one, but we can totally randomize this. You know, I mean, that too, like, we should also have it always say, uh, for the, for the user, it should always be sequential, even if it's random, I think. Yeah. Where it doesn't jump to like question 932, it just still says like question two, question three. Oh yeah. That's doable too. Let's see. Can I update this live? Oh, that's nice. You can't. Nice. Okay. Whew. So, finding questions was harder than I thought. Like, because it's, it's like when I was like, key wording problems where when you type in questions and do a search query, it's like, it like, like websites that are like answers to your questions. Like, everything you wanted to know about Zigman Freud. No, no, I want like questions that like an analyst would ask. Yeah. So I got to figure that out. That's only a trick. I mean, I did add those, the shadow questions to the data set and I mean, it's, we're probably pretty good. Let's see. I mean, like we have 860 questions. Yeah. I just, I want to get, I want to have it be, this is something I could build on in the future. We don't have to do it right away. But I do in the end want to have it be like questions from every single like part of society. Okay. So, you know, it's like, like questions here. Let me, let me go to my fucked up text file. Notetaking system. Yes. And I'll just copy and paste my notes into the chat. Okay. Let's see. This is not an exhaustive list. But this will give you an idea kind of my thinking. Oops. Okay. So something, the, something from Aila, the sexy events application. So that just, when you copy a link, it just bumps it to the bottom of the, there's text above the thing I said. Oh. Yeah. I hate how, I hate how those apps do that. It's good. Like you lose a lot of, like the information you're actually trying to transmit. Wait. Oh, so what do you want me to click? Sorry what? Let's go back to the Skype chat. And then if you, so like, I was like, cause I, I just put, there's just links in what I copied. So just, it bumped like those, the nails. Okay. Yeah. Those are just in my notes. I wasn't. Okay. Use URL fuzzing data screen to collect other people's data collection methods and review questions. Okay. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Okay. So, I'm going to go back to the next slide. Okay. Okay. So, I'm going to go back to the next slide. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to go back to the next slide. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. get down maggots okay hold on I think we're good I'm gonna I'm not export this this file now
