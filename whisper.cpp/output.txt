[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Alrighty.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   So, what false belief did I shed that liberated me?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   There's probably a few.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I think that the first thing that comes to mind is...
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Oh crap.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I don't know.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   False belief.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I feel like there's so many.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   False of belief.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I think the biggest one probably is that I'm not my mind.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Like the words that run through my head is not me.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So yeah, I can probably go into a lot more depth about that.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And I will when I actually come to fill this out.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   But yeah, definitely it's got to be that.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   That my thoughts are not me.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And that the thing that is conscious in me is something deeper than that.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And that my mind is a tool.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And the thoughts that come from the mind are tools.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And I definitely don't live in that constantly.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I mean, I for sure have times when my mind consumes me.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   But it is something that's really important for me to keep in mind.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   In mind, in mind.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yes, the mind.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Okay, this is a good test response.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Let's see how accurate it is and being able to transcribe this.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   [silence]
